## üìö API Reference

### Constructor
```csharp
public SerialPort(
    string portName,
    int baudRate = 115200,
    int dataBits = 8,
    Parity parity = Parity.None,
    StopBits stopBits = StopBits.One,
    int readBufferSize = 8192,
    int writeBufferSize = 8192,
    TimeoutModel timeoutModel = TimeoutModel.WaitAny,
    int timeout = 2000)
``` 

### Open 
```csharp
public void Open()
``` 

### Close 
```csharp
public void Close()
``` 

### Read/ReadAsync 
```csharp
int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)

Task<int> ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
``` 
### Write/WriteAsync 
```csharp
int Write(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)

Task<int> WriteAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
``` 

## ‚è∞ Timeout Behavior 


| TimeoutModel | Start read on empty buffer | Partial data arrives (less than requested bytes) | All data arrives during read |
|-|-|-|-|
| TimeoutModel.Immediately          | Return 0 bytes                         |Return immediately                     | Return immediately    |
| TimeoutModel.WaitAny(default)     | Wait until data arrives (cancellable)  | Return immediately                    | Return immediately    |
| TimeoutModel.WaitAll              | Wait until data arrives (cancellable)  | Wait until data arrives (cancellable) | Return immediately    |
